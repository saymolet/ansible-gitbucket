This ansible playbook is intented for personal use. But feel free to borrow or modify it for your needs.

## Requirements
* The architecture allows for 1 Load Balancer, 1 Shared Database, 1 Shared NFS Server, and an `n` number of workers. So in total you need to have `3 + n` servers. 
* All servers must be some flavor of `RHEL`, `Oracle Linux` or `CentOS`.  
* Firewall rules restrict ingress trafic to `10.26.0.0/24` mask, so be aware of that.


### On Host:
* `dnf update`
* `dnf install ansible-core`
* `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`

## Usage
Edit `hosts` file to include your managed machine adresses. Configure an ssh connection to your managed machines.

Ð¡hange the default password 'root' for vault.yml:
```console
ansible-vault rekey group_vars/all/vault.yml
ansible-vault rekey group_vars/db_servers/vault.yml
```

Change default password variables inside `vault.yml` with:
```console
ansible-vault edit group_vars/all/vault.yml
ansible-vault edit group_vars/db_servers/vault.yml
```

Initiate a playbook by running:
```console
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -i production site.yml
```
